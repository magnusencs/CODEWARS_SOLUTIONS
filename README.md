# KATA_SOLUTIONS
This repository contains all the solutions I’ve submitted on **Codewars** and **LeetCode** challenges.  

⚠️ Keep in mind:
- I didn’t revise or optimize most of these — so don’t expect “perfect” code here.  
- These solutions are my raw attempts, straight from my own thinking process.  
- Most of the code snippets are just functions — you’ll need to create your own `int main()` to run them (I’m lazy, sorry 😅).
